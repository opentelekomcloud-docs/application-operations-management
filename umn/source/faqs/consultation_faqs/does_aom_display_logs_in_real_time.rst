Does AOM Display Logs in Real Time?
===================================

The logs displayed on Application Operations Management (AOM) are near real-time logs, of which the latency is in seconds.

There is a time interval between log collection and processing. If the number of logs is small, the latency is about 10s. If the number of logs is large, the latency is much longer.
