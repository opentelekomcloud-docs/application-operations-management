Obtaining an AK/SK
==================

.. note::

   Each user can create a maximum of two AK/SK pairs. Once they are generated, they are permanently valid.

-  AK: unique ID associated with the SK. It is used together with the SK to sign requests.
-  SK: secret access key used in conjunction with an AK to sign requests cryptographically. It identifies a request sender and prevents the request from being modified.

Procedure

#. Log in to the management console, hover the mouse pointer over the username in the upper right corner, and select **My Credentials** from the drop-down list.
#. On the **My Credentials** page, click the **Access Keys** tab.
#. Click **Create Access Key**. In the dialog box that is displayed, enter the login password and verification code sent to your email or mobile phone.
#. Click **OK** and download the generated AK/SK pair.
