How Do I Obtain an AK/SK?
=========================

Each user can create a maximum of two Access Key ID/Secret Access Key (AK/SK) pairs. Once they are generated, they are permanently valid.

-  AK: unique ID associated with the SK. It is used together with the SK to sign requests.
-  SK: secret access key used in conjunction with an AK to sign requests cryptographically. It identifies a request sender and prevents the request from being modified.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console, hover the mouse pointer over the username in the upper right corner, and select **My Credentials** from the drop-down list.

#. On the **My Credentials** page, click the **Access Keys** tab.

#. Click **Create Access Key** above the list, and enter the verification code or password.

#. Click **OK** to download the generated AK/SK.

   You can obtain the AK from the access key list and SK from the downloaded CSV file.

   .. note::

      -  Keep the CSV file properly. You can only download the file right after the access key is created. If you cannot find the file, you can create an access key again.
      -  Open the CSV file in the lower left corner, or choose **Downloads** in the upper right corner of the browser and open the CSV file.
      -  Keep your access keys secure and change them periodically for security purposes.
