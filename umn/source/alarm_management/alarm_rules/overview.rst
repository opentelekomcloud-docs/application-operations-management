Overview
========

By setting alarms rules, you can define threshold conditions for resource metrics. A threshold alarm is generated when the metric data of a resource meets the threshold condition. An insufficient data event is generated when no metric data is reported.

Generally, threshold rules are used to monitor the usage of resources such as hosts and components in the environment in real time.

The total number of threshold rules is 1000. If the number of alarm rules has reached the upper limit, delete unnecessary rules and create new ones.
