Metric Configuration
====================

**Metric Collection** determines whether to collect metrics (excluding SLA and custom metrics).

#. Log in to the AOM console. In the navigation pane, choose **Configuration Management** > **Metric Configuration**.

#. Enable or disable metric collection.

   .. note::

      After the metric collection function is disabled, ICAgents will stop collecting metric data and related metric data will not be updated. However, custom metrics can still be reported.
