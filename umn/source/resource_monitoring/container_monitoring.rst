Container Monitoring
====================

Container and component monitoring differs in their monitored objects. For component monitoring, workloads deployed using Cloud Container Engine (CCE), and components deployed on Elastic Cloud Server (ECS) or Bare Metal Server (BMS) are monitored. For container monitoring, only workloads deployed using CCE are monitored. For details, see :ref:`Component Monitoring <aom_02_0007>`.
