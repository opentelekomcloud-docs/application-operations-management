What Is AOM?
============

Challenges
----------

With the popularization of container technologies, lots of enterprises develop applications using microservice frameworks. Because the number of cloud services increases, enterprises gradually turn to cloud O&M. However, they face the following O&M challenges:

-  Cloud O&M has high requirements on personnel skills. O&M tools are hard to configure. Multiple systems need to be maintained at the same time. Distributed tracing systems face high learning and usage costs, but have poor stability.
-  Distributed applications face analysis difficulties such as how to visualize the dependency between microservices, improve user experience, associate scattered logs for analysis, and quickly trace problems.

Introduction to AOM

Application Operations Management (AOM) is a one-stop, multi-dimensional O&M management platform for cloud applications. It monitors your applications and related cloud resources, analyzes application health status in real time, and provides flexible data visualization functions, helping you monitor running status of applications, resources, and services in real time and detect faults in a timely manner.

-  **Management over massive quantities of logs**

   AOM supports log search and service analysis, automatically associates logs for cluster analysis, and filters logs by application, host, file, or instance.

-  **Association analysis**

   AOM automatically associates applications and resources and displays data in a panorama view. Through analysis of metrics and alarms about applications, components, instances, hosts, and transactions, AOM allows you to easily locate faults.

-  **Open ecosystem**

   O&M data query APIs are opened, collection standards are provided, and independent development is supported.
