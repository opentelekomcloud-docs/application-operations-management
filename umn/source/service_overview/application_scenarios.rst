Application Scenarios
=====================

Problem Inspection and Demarcation
----------------------------------

During routine O&M, it is hard to locate faults and obtain logs. Therefore, a monitoring platform is required to monitor resources, logs, and application performance.

AOM interconnects with application services, and collects O&M data of infrastructures, middleware, and application instances in one stop. Through metric monitoring, log analysis, and alarm reporting, AOM enables you to monitor the application running status and resource usage easily, and detect and demarcate problems in a timely manner.

**Advantages**

-  Automatic discovery of applications: Collectors are deployed to proactively discover and monitor applications based on different runtime environments.
-  Monitoring of distributed applications: AOM serves as a unified O&M platform that enables you to implement multi-dimensional monitoring over distributed applications with multiple cloud services.
-  Alarm notification: Multiple exception detection policies, alarm trigger modes, and APIs are provided.

Multi-Dimensional O&M
---------------------

You need to monitor comprehensive system running status and make fast response to various problems.

AOM provides multi-dimensional O&M capabilities from the cloud level to the resource level and from application monitoring to microservice tracing.

**Advantages**

-  User experience assurance: Service health status KPIs in real time are monitored in real time and root causes of exceptions are analyzed.
-  Fast fault diagnosis: Distributed call tracing enables you to locate faults quickly.
-  Resource running assurance: Hundreds of O&M metrics about resources such as containers, disks, and networks are monitored in real time, and clusters, VMs, applications, and containers are associated for analysis.
