Viewing Events
==============

Generally, events carry important information, informing you of the changes of AOM itself or an external service such as Cloud Container Engine (CCE). Such changes do not necessarily cause exceptions. Events do not need to be handled.


Viewing Events
--------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Under **Application**, click **Application Operations Management**.

#. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarm Center** > **Events**.

   Events are displayed by time. The latest event is displayed at the topmost of the event list.

   Set the time range or filter criteria.

   a. Set the time range.

      View the events generated within the time range. There are two methods to set a time range:

      Method 1: Use the predefined time label, such as **Last 1 hour**, **Last 6 hours**, or **Last 1 day**. You can select a time range as required.

      Method 2: Specify the start time and end time to customize a time range. You can specify 30 days at most.

   b. Set filter criteria.

      Enter an event name and source, and click **Search**.

      .. note::

         -  You can click **Reset** to reset filter criteria.
         -  You can enter multiple event sources and separate them by using commas (,) to filter events.
         -  Event names and sources are case-sensitive.

#. View the search result.

   -  In the bar graph, view the statistics of events that meet the filter criterion within the time range specified in :ref:`4 <aom_02_0045__li14478446171411>`.
