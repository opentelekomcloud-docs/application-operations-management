Instance Metrics and Dimensions
===============================

Instance metrics consist of container or process metrics. The dimensions of instance metrics are the same as those of container or process metrics. For details, see :ref:`Container Metrics and Dimensions <aom_02_1021>` and :ref:`Process Metrics and Dimensions <aom_02_1022>`.

For workloads deployed on Cloud Container Engine (CCE), AOM supports drill-down from services to service instances, containers, and processes. For services that directly run on VMs, AOM supports drill-down from services to service instances and processes. In this way, you can implement multi-dimensional monitoring.
